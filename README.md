# Data-Science-Projects
Selected projects from relevant coursework using R

This repo contains some of my work from courses in which I employed R to solve various real-world type problems. These include topics in science, finance, and economics.

Each file folder (with the exception of Time-Series Forecasting) contains the question in a PDF document, solution in a .docx format, the source code in a R file and data files in txt and csv format. Image outputs will be displyed in pdf and png format. Time-Series Forecasting includes a PowerPoint and R code files instead.

A brief look at the projects:

1) The Capture-Recapture Method - Using Monte Carlo Simluation, the goal is to empirically test two different estimators for the size of a natural population. We would like to see if either of the models are good poulation size estimators by using various sample sizes in our simulation and testing for the bias and variance produced using each method.

2) Chocolate and Nobel Prizes (Linear Regression) - Reconstructing cardiologist Franz H. Messerli's experiment, I analyze how the amount of chocolate consumption in each country is positively correlated with a higher production of Nobel Laureates from that country and what this implies. His study is meant to be taken more as a satire, to show "whether correlation implies causation" - the answer is no. His study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2012.
